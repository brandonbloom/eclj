# Extensible Clojure

An extensible, symbolic, functionally-pure Clojure interpreter.

EClojure aims to completely virtualize the Clojure language, such that
portable Clojure code can be run within a precisely controlled environment.
Proper tail calls are supported via delimited continuations, which enables all
effects to be modeled as pure data. Effects, including bidirectional interop,
are processed at the top-level of the interpreter loop, so they too are fully
programmable.

This project's ambitious goals are based on a vast academic foundation.  Oleg
Kiselyov's [Extensible Effects & Interpreters][1] page provides an excellent
entry point.
